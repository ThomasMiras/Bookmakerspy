    "The current notebook \"bookmakerspy_preprocessing_dataviz\" is the second in a series of 4 notebooks. It uses the dataset output by the first notebook \"bookmakerspy_data_collection\" and it is followed by \"bookmakerspy_modelisation\" and \"bookmakerspy_odds_strategy\".\n",

    "This notebook aims at pre-processing the \"df_stats_odds\" dataframe by grouping or creating variables, and at exploring the data through data visualizations so as to emphasize patterns and make assumptions about potential strategies for creating a model. We have iterated over these two steps: pre-processing and data visualizations over time, meaning that some initial exploration with data visualizations has enabled us to refine the data processing steps and we have gone back and forth between these two steps. They should consequently not be approached as a linear process but more as a dynamic process where data visualization and pre-processing steps helped gaining a better understanding of the data overall.\n",
